        there is a space for each and every student to use this opportunity to hone their leadership skills and attitude and learn to take charge of the situations
        students are able to own up and contribute to the various processes and realise their larger role in shaping their own experiences and learning
        the model is scalable to plug and play more NavGurukuls leading to more and more students to benefit from this
        There are many hiccups that come in the way of a smoothly running system. It needs people to take ownership and set things right. This constitution provides a framework to work in a structured manner - leading to growth of every member while efficiently tackling the problem that may arise on a day-to-day basis.</p>
        
        <p>You can use this opportunity to understand and appreciate your own role to create a safe space that prospers learning and love amongst all. May this constitution and every effort that we make. NavGurukul's constitution adopts principles of the Swaraj and a rule by people, for the people. It is important that each and every member of the facility feels empowered by the constitution and the elected members act as facilitators rather than as power centers. To ensure that the power lies with all the members there are various safeguards like Right to Recall, but most importantly the right culture leads to the same. Hence, each member is encouraged to participate and take ownership.</p>

        <h1>Hyberabd History</h1>
        <p>Hyderabad, city, Telangana state, south-central India. It is Telangana's largest and most-populous city and is the major urban centre for all of south-central interior India. From 1956 to 2014 Hyderabad was the capital of Andhra Pradesh state, but, with the creation of Telangana from Andhra Pradesh in 2014, it was redesignated as the capital of both states.

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Hyderabad was founded by the Quṭb Shāhī sultans of Golconda, under whom the kingdom of Golconda attained a position of importance second only to that of the Mughal Empire to the north. The old fortress town of Golconda had proved inadequate as the kingdom's capital, and so about 1591 Muḥammad Qulī Quṭb Shah, the fifth of the Quṭb Shahs, built a new city called Hyderabad on the east bank of the Musi River, a short distance from old Golconda. The Charminar, a grand architectural composition in Indo-Saracenic style with open arches and four minarets, is regarded as the supreme achievement of the Quṭb Shāhī period. It formed the centrepiece around which the city was planned. The Mecca Mosque, which was built later, can accommodate 10,000 people. The mosque was the site of a bombing attack in 2007 that killed several Muslims and injured many others. The incident aggravated Muslim-Hindu tensions in the city, which has experienced periodic outbreaks of violence over the years.
