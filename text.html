        <p class="container container-center">Hi, Hello everyone. I am a sindhu student at the navgurkul organization. I have completed 8 months in the navgurukul organizatio it was a great experience for me. I have learned many new things and made many friends all over India. I would like to tell the navgurukl is not an organization, It's like a great family. I will learn many new things in navgurkul organization like coding, dance, music, English and communication skills, etc. I'm very lucky to be part of the navgurukul constitution. No pain no gain, gain no pain.</p>
    <p class="container container-center">I like the culture of navgurukul ! the way we mingle with everyone is like a family, this is like mini India where people come from different states their culture is also different and food too. I never felt that I'm missing my family because the community will treat us like a family if are facing any problem they will support us and motivate us I'm very happy to stay in navgurukul I meet my new friends those who love and care toward's me.
